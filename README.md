# Game Hacking & Cracking

I made a gitHub repo that contains links to multiple websites and tools that will help you, because bookmarking everything will get annoying after a while.

Links with a ⭐ are recommended by me as I think they have the best website/tool - It's all personal opinion.

If you would like to add something then make a pull request and change/add or remove anything and explain why
